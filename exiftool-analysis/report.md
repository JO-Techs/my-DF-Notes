## Inference
The file has gone through multiple edits:
- Initially created and edited in Adobe Premiere Pro and GIMP.
- Final save done in GIMP 2.10.24 on Windows.
- The filename extension is `.png`, but the actual file type is JPEG.

These metadata clearly show it is **not an original photo** from a camera; instead, it was processed and exported manually.  
No EXIF camera fields or GPS data are present.
